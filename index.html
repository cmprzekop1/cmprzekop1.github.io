                                To simplify and quicken the process of parallel parking on the road the goal of the system and project is to enable a car to park itself. However, it would be too costly and risky to 
                                incorporate the system on a real car so instead a four-wheel drive RC car will be used as a supplement to the car. The parking space will be a predefined spot and the car will pull up to the 
                                spot before parking. The car will also use four IR sensors to measure the distance to the spot and a finite state machine to maneuver the car into place. 
                                The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of an FPGA to use precise measurements and calculations to perform real world tasks. The plan is to use a mix of battery and lab bench 
                                power sources to provide enough energy input to power the system and to maintain the selfcontained integrity of the project with the mounted Basys2 FPGA

                                The Global Filters Market Size accounted for USD 33.5 Billion in 2021 and is estimated to achieve a market size of USD 45.2 Billion by 2027 growing at a CAGR of 6.2% from 2022 to 2027 (https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Market-Reports/industrial-filtration-market-81304454.html ).  Of these filters, the market only prominently carries one capsule-like filter that allows complete portability of filtration. The fault of this filter is that it fails to capture microplastics (https://twistoflemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Go-Pure-Pod-Research.pdf ). As microplastics are projected to be apparent in all forms of consumption today, and more than 10 billion tons of plastic waste is assumed to be dispersed in the environment by 2025 (https://orbmedia.org/the-invisibles), it is imperative we find an accessable and cheap solution. Due to their high surface area, microplastics carry harsh chemicals, heavy, metals, and cancer inducing molecules.

                                Using a newly researched method of wood dust, tannic acids, and polyphenols (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.202301531). The proposal is to connect this solution with an activated carbon chassis small enough to fit into most plastic drinking bottles and cups. The connection would be made by either a polymer binder such as polyethylene glycol/gelatin, crosslinking agent such as glutaraldehyde, or a silane coupling agent. The activated carbon chassis can provide a signifcant reduction in heavy metals within the fluid and the wood mixture would effectivly remove microplastics, providing the user with a significiantly safer drink. SEM and TEM will be used to analyze the effectiveness of the product to capture microplastics and heavy metals. The most optimal filter casing is either in microcapsules or hydrophilic materials.

                                This website was built as both a learning project and a hobby. I originally had all of my information on LinkedIn but quickly realized that it was not enough to showcase everything I wanted to about myself. So I took what I learned from previous CS courses and built this website. It hosts a lot of informaton about me that you can find on LinkedIn, but more importantly it gives a better platform to showcase my engineering journey. So far I have tried to desing projects in vaious areas of the engineering field to get experience in most areas. I feel that this is a great way to implement ideas from all areas of engineering. The website was built in HTML with a CSS design script and JS animation file. You can find the code in my Github which I have linked to the header of this section :)

                                During my period at Spectrum Control I was a software and hardware engineering intern. I was tasked within my group of helping develop the intial stages of a powerup sequence for a RF device.
                                While under this task I had created a Python script allowing the team to easily encode the FPGA's we were working with to simulate signals as a part of this powerup sequence. This was done to test the components
                                of the device we were working with. Further, I was tasked with finding and documenting any changes or modifications that would be needed for the physical design. I studied many spec sheets and helped physcially modify
                                a lot of the hardware we were using through soldering. I then wired the initial protoype of the device to be later tested with both solder and jumper wires.
